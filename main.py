# The split and list methods convert a string into a list, while the join method does the opposite.

# See what happens when you print phrase.split() vs. phrase.split('e') vs. list(phrase). What is the purpose of the argument inside the ()?


# See what happens when you print ''.join(my_list) vs. 'a'.join(my_list) vs. '_'.join(my_list). What is the purpose of the argument inside the ()?


# Split the cargo_hold string at each comma, alphabetize the list with sort, then combine the elements into a new string. Use a hyphen to join the elements together in the string.


# Do split, list, or join change the original string/list?
